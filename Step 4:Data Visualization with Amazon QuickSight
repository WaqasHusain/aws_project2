Steps to be Performed

#1 Connect to the Data Source
#2 Build a QuickSight Dashboard
#3 Share and Publish the Dashboard

#1 Connect to the Data Source: ------->

We’ve successfully automated the ingestion and transformation of CSV data using S3, Lambda, and AWS Glue.
The final step is to visualize this processed data using Amazon QuickSight, which will help turn processed data into actionable insights.
We need to connect QuickSight to the processed data stored in S3.

In the QuickSight console, go to the Datasets section and click New Dataset.
Select S3 as the data source.
Provide the following details:
Data Source Name: ProcessedCSV
Manifest File: Create a manifest file in your local machine with the following content and upload it from your local machine.
Add the Object URL you copied earlier and replace it in the placeholder.

json
{
  "fileLocations": [
    {
      "URIs": [
        "ENTER YOUR OBJECT URL HERE"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "globalUploadSettings": {
    "textqualifier": "\""
  }
}

Upload the manifest file and click Connect.
Click Visualize to load the data into QuickSight.

#2 Build a QuickSight Dashboard: ------->

Let’s create a dashboard to visualize the insights from the transformed CSV data.
Click Add to create a new analysis.
Select the ProcessedCSVData dataset.

Build the following visualizations:
Bar Chart: Compare values from different columns.
Line Chart: Analyze trends over time.
You can try out different charts by using the columns available in the dataset.

#3 Share and Publish the Dashboard: ------->

Select Publish Dashboard to make it accessible to other users.

Final Check: ------->

QuickSight account set up and configured.
Data source connected and loaded into QuickSight.
Dashboard created with meaningful visualizations.
Pipeline tested with new data, ensuring dynamic updates.
