Setup and Configuration

Steps to be Performed: ------->
Create S3 Buckets
Configure IAM Roles and Policies
Setup Amazon QuickSight

#1 Create S3 Buckets: ------->
Amazon S3 will be the backbone of our pipeline, acting as storage for raw, processed and final data.
Here we will be creating three S3 buckets for storing— Raw, processed and final data respectively. 
Log in to AWS Console and navigate to the S3 service.

Click on “Create bucket”.
Fill out the following details:
Bucket Name: Use descriptive names like csv-raw-data for raw data , csv-processed-data for processed data and csv-final-data for final data.
Region: Choose the same region for all resources in this project (e.g., us-east-1).

Leave the rest of the options at default and click Create bucket.
Repeat this process to create a other two buckets for processed data and final data.
In the end, you should be having 3 buckets for raw, processed and final data. 
Tip: Keep your bucket names unique across all AWS accounts. Use a naming convention like your-project-name-raw.

#2 Configure IAM Roles and Policies: ------->
IAM (Identity and Access Management) ensures our services can securely communicate and operate. We will ensure proper permissions are given to AWS Lambda and AWS Glue.

Create an IAM Role for Lambda:
Go to the IAM Console → Roles → Create role.
Select AWS Service as the trusted entity and choose Lambda.
Click Next and attach the following policies:
AmazonS3FullAccess (to read/write S3 buckets).
AWSGlueServiceRoll (for Glue operations).
Name the role Lambda-S3-Glue-Role and click Create Role.

Create an IAM Role for Glue:
Go to Roles → Create role.
Select AWS Service and choose Glue.
Attach these policies:
AWSGlueServiceRole
AmazonS3FullAccess
Name the role Glue-Service-Role and click Create Role.

#3 Set Up Amazon QuickSight: ------->
Amazon QuickSight helps you visualize your processed data. Let’s setup your QuickSight account:
Open QuickSight:
In the AWS Console, search for QuickSight and open the service.
If you don’t have an account yet, click Sign up for QuickSight.
Add your email. For the Authentication Method, check Use IAM federated identities & QuickSight-managed users.
Choose the US-East region (Same region as your buckets).Add a QuickSight Account Name. 
For the IAM role, check the Use QuickSight-managed role (default).

Configure QuickSight Settings:
In the Allow Access, Click on Select S3 Buckets.
Select the previously created three S3 buckets. Click on Finish.
Uncheck the option- Add Pixel Perfect Reports and click on Finish.
Now QuickSight is ready to access and visualize data from S3.

Final Check
You should now have:
Three S3 buckets created (csv-raw-data , csv-processed-data and csv-final-data).
IAM roles for Lambda and Glue with the necessary permissions.
A QuickSight account linked to your processed data bucket.
